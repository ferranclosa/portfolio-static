        <p>Architecture is a natural progression path from a senior developper, if you have inclination to progress and ambition. As 
          Architect I have been involved in adapting Legacy systems and making them progress forward. The use of Microservices, Web, Cloud and the

        <h6>4 years</h6>
        <p>RPG is an IBM computer language used in a mid-frame server family, called iSeries or AS/400. 
          It is used by mid/large size companies, 
          as it is a server capable of serving fully-fledged applications. This would be the opposite of distributed computing. 
          Having it all in one server (Database, computing engine, presentation layer) was very appealing to companies, for cost and 
          simplicity. This simplicity has, however, become a burden and a limitator for the Digital era.

        <h6>4 years</h6>
        <p>My first steps on IT were on the old school languages, with COBOL and Structured Programing. 
          I was fascinated by the Object Oriented paradigm. I self taught Object Pascal, Delphi and Visual Basic. 
          I worked in a Training company both as trainer and I put my new skills into practice by opening up the 
          on-location and on-site courses to on-line and distance learning. By doing so, opening a new market for the company.</p>

        <h6>30 + years</h6>
        <p>IT languages and frameworks evolve rapidly. I believe that, underneath, a set of 
          common patterns and use cases allow for developping a 
          cross-language or cross-framework sense of common ground. Once you identify the use case or pattern, you can 
          check for its implementation on a different language. The languages/frameworks I have worked with, mostly have been:
